                <p>Hello, I'm Sofia Santos (forgive the redundancy), a web designer and developer based in Portugal. I'm basically a designer who codes.</p>
                <p>I'm twenty-three years old and was born and raised in Coimbra, Portugal, where I've recently completed my bachelor's degree in Design and Multimedia. It was back in 2018 that this challenging craft made its appearance in my life, haunting my Google search history since then.</p>
                <p>In the past few years, my approach to web dev has been a mixture of continuous learning and commitment to stay up-to-date with new technologies, knowing there's so much more to learn. I've worked on some projects such as the ones in this portfolio, which I invite you to take a look at. As for now, I'm currently open to a new professional challenge, in order to be able to put my learning and skills into practice.</p>
